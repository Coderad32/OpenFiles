# Welcome Dapplication platform

A smaller sized SAAS digital company starting fresh with goal
of providing a quality service API for all that wish to use it.

## What is a Dapplication

Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs 
that run on a decentralized network rather than a single computer or server. 
They are built on blockchain technology and use cryptocurrency as a means of exchange.

## Main Menu

- SaaS(software as a service) API
- Web 3.0( security onboarding )
- Web 4.0( advanced automation )
- Token( share project )

Each topic I would like to discuss today with you is about creating
independence freedom and transform the digital landscape into something
of value.

## SaaS API

SaaS API (Software as a Service Application Programming Interface) is a combination of a business model and technology 
that allows users to access data and features of a cloud-hosted software application through an API instead of a user interface. 
APIs are sets of tools, standards, and protocols that allow software applications to connect and share data

## Web 3.0

Web 3.0, also known as Web3, is the third generation of the World Wide Web (WWW). 
It's a decentralized, open, and bottom-up designed internet that's built on blockchain technologies and the Semantic Web. 
Web3 is intended to give users more ownership and fewer middlemen, and could change how 
information is managed, monetized, and how web-based corporations function.


## Web 4.0


Web 4.0, also known as the "Intelligent Web" or "smart Web", is a hypothetical future stage of the World Wide Web 
that aims to be more user-friendly, intuitive, and intelligent. It's characterized by a shift from static web pages 
to more interactive and dynamic applications that are designed to be more collaborative and allow users to easily 
share information and ideas.
