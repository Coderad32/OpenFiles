# Welcome Dapplication Platform

A smaller sized SAAS digital asset holdings company 

starting fresh with goal of creating a mechanical token
used for infastructure purposes as part of a digital strategy.

and to provide a quality service API for all that wish to use it.
## SAAS Company

To keep people happy there will be a clear goal for dist of token asset classification units.

- software as a service
- Digital Holdings
- Asset Creation

## What is a Dapplication

Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs 
that run on a decentralized network rather than a single computer or server. 
They are built on blockchain technology and use cryptocurrency as a means of exchange.

## Main Menu

- SaaS(software as a service) API
- Web 3.0( security onboarding )

- Web 3.0 Keywords:

## Decentralization: 
Web 3.0 is characterized by decentralized networks, often powered by blockchain technology.

## Semantic Web: 
Enhancing web technologies to generate, share, and connect content through search and analysis based on the ability to understand the meaning of words.

## Token Economy: 
The use of cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize and monetize online interactions and transactions.

## User Empowerment: 
Users have more control over their data and can potentially profit from their online activities.

## Interoperability: 
Different blockchain networks and systems can work together seamlessly.

## Web 4.0 Keywords:
## Symbiotic Web: 
Web 4.0 is envisioned as a symbiotic web where humans and machines can interact more intuitively, possibly through mind-controlled interfaces.

## Advanced Automation:
Incorporating advanced AI and machine learning to automate tasks and provide personalized experiences.

## Cerebral Internet: 
Speculations suggest that Web 4.0 could be more integrated with human thought processes.

## Ubiquitous Computing: 
Computing that is available anytime and everywhere, possibly embedded in everyday objects.

- Web 4.0( advanced automation )
- Token( share project )
- Infastructure Token unit
- planned contract
- planned DATA: feed
- results: return
  
Each topic I would like to discuss today with you is about creating
independence freedom and transform the digital landscape into something
of value.

## SaaS API

SaaS API (Software as a Service Application Programming Interface) is a combination of a business model and technology 
that allows users to access data and features of a cloud-hosted software application through an API instead of a user interface. 
APIs are sets of tools, standards, and protocols that allow software applications to connect and share data

## Web 3.0

Web 3.0, also known as Web3, is the third generation of the World Wide Web (WWW). 
It's a decentralized, open, and bottom-up designed internet that's built on blockchain technologies and the Semantic Web. 
Web3 is intended to give users more ownership and fewer middlemen, and could change how 
information is managed, monetized, and how web-based corporations function.


## Web 4.0


Web 4.0, also known as the "Intelligent Web" or "smart Web", is a hypothetical future stage of the World Wide Web 
that aims to be more user-friendly, intuitive, and intelligent. It's characterized by a shift from static web pages 
to more interactive and dynamic applications that are designed to be more collaborative and allow users to easily 
share information and ideas.


## Tokenize / Security
